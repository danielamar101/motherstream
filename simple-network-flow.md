# Simple Network Flow: staging.motherstream.live → Your App

## 🔄 The Problem & Solution

### ❌ **Current (Broken)**
```
Internet → staging.motherstream.live → 70.21.137.40 → Your Server → [NOTHING LISTENING] → FAIL
```

### ✅ **After nginx Setup (Working)**
```
Internet → staging.motherstream.live → 70.21.137.40 → Your Server → nginx → Minikube → Your App
```

## 📍 Simple Flow Diagram

```
1. User visits staging.motherstream.live
   ↓
2. DNS resolves to 70.21.137.40 (your external IP)
   ↓
3. Router forwards to 192.168.1.231:80 (your server)
   ↓
4. Host nginx receives request
   ↓
5. nginx forwards to 192.168.49.2:31741 (minikube)
   ↓
6. Minikube ingress routes to staging pods
   ↓
7. User sees staging app ✅
```

## 🎯 What We Need to Fix

**The Missing Piece:** Nothing is listening on port 80 on your server!

**The Solution:** Install nginx on your host system to:
- Listen on port 80/443 for `staging.motherstream.live`
- Forward all staging traffic to your minikube cluster
- Leave production completely untouched

## 🚀 Quick Summary

- **Install nginx** on your physical server (192.168.1.231)
- **Configure it** to proxy `staging.motherstream.live` → minikube
- **Your production services** remain completely unchanged
- **External users** can now access your staging environment

That's it! The setup script does all of this automatically.
